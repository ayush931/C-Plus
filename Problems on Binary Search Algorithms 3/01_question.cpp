// You have 'n' (n <= 10^5) boxes of chocolates. Each box contains a[i] (a[i] <= 10000) chocolates. You need to distribute these boxes among 'm' students such that the minimum number of chocolates allocated to a student is minimum.
// a. One box will be allocated to exactly one student.
// b. All the boxes should be allocated.
// c. Each student has to be allocated at least one box.
// d. Allotment should be in contiguous order, for instance, a student cannot be allocated box 1 and box 3, skipping box 2.
// Calculate and return that minimum possible number. Assume that it is always possible to distribute the chocolates.

// The first line of input will contain the value of n, the number of boxes.
// The second line of input will contain the n numbers of denoting the number of chocolates in each box.
// The third line will contain the m, number of students.
